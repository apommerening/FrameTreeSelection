# FrameTreeSelection
This data repository relates to the Tamm review (Forest Ecology and Management) entitled "Individual-based forest management or Seeing the trees for the forest".

The filename includes the location, the year and the thinning type applied, e.g. Ae2011ThinningEx1.txt refers to the data from a low-thinning experiment held ar Ae in 2011. Ae2011ThinningEx2.txt contains the data of a crown-thinning experiment held at the same location in the same year. Whilst these two files include information on trees to be removed, Ae2011FrameEx2.txt contains information on the frame trees selected in the crown-thinning experiment.

The data are saved as text files and the data columns are tabulator delimited.

In each file, the data columns are organised as follows:

Treenumber: Number assigned to the tree described in a particular row
Species: Tree species coded in letters using the UK Forestry Commission species codings, e.g. SS - Sitka spruce
dbh: Stem diameter at breast height (1.3 m above ground level) in cm
h: Total tree height in m
Formfactor: Form factor describing the deviation of tree stem from a cylinder
Quality: Qualitative assessment of timber quality using quality classes a-c
X: Cartesian x coordinate of tree location in m
Y: Cartesian y coordinate of tree location in m

The following columns give the marking results, i.e. each rater is represented by one column. "0" means "not selected" and "1" means "selected".
